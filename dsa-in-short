1. Count Sum of pairs where arrya is sorted and elements can repeat - 
    Two pointers and/or hashmap, to select 2 elements from 'x' number  elements use nc2 which is x(x-1)/2

2. Linked list find cycle
    a. take slow fast pointer, when pointers meet at X, then from X go to next using pointer P and from head go to next using pointer H, 
    the point where P and H meet is the cycle start
    Linked List questions are best done if you draw it on paper first. complexity is mostly O(n)
    b. Take hashmap, store addresses in hashmap. when addrss repeats that is the cycle point
